60% O-ring keyboard

## Main features:  
* Unikorn-like O-ring mount  
* Space for a 402080 battery installation  
* Front height = 17.7 mm  
* C-series daughterboard compatibility  
* Most 60% O-ring PCBs will fit  

## Why?  
I was heavily inspired by the Bakeneko and Aperture (a keyboard from the local community with no worldwide GB). So I decided to combine the best of both and make it available to anyone who enjoys DIY projects as much as I do.  
The hole serves multiple purposes at once: it helps reduce the front height without any consequences (but affects the sound, of course) and makes pulling out the whole PCB sandwich much more convenient. 
I ordered the prototype from Rapid Direct in PEI Ultem — the price and quality were amazing.

### What do you need to build one yourself:  
* 1 × Pelican case (printed, machined, etc.)  
* 1 × Unified C-Series daughterboard + connection cable according to your PCB  
* 1 × Almost any 60% O-ring PCB, but it should have tabs for the Unikorn mount (4 on top, 4 on bottom)  
* 1 × Plate according to your PCB  
* 4 × M2 × 3mm screws  
* 1 × 60% O-ring  
* 4 × Oval feet 20×3×1.5  
* 1 × 402080 battery (only in case of a wireless PCB)
