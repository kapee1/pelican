## Main features:
* Unikorn-like O-ring mount
* Space for 402080 battery installation
* Front height = 17.7 mm 
* C-series daughterboard compatability
* Most of 60% o-ring PCB will fit 


## Why? 
I was heavily inspired by Bakeneko and Aperture (Keyboard from local community with no worldwide GB). So I decided to combine the best from both of them, and make it available for anyone who enjoys DIY projects as much as I do.
I ordered the prototype at Rapid Direct in PEI Ultem, price and quality was amazing. 
Hole serves many things at once: it helps to reduce the front height without any consequences (but affects the sound, of course) and it makes pulling out a whole PCB sandwich much more convenient.

* 1 x Pelican Case (Printed, machined, etc)
* 1 x Unified C-Series daughterboard + with connection cable according to your PCB
* 1 x Almost any 60% o-ring PCBs, but it should have tabs for unikorn-mount (4 on top, 4 on bottom)
* 1 x Plate according to your PCB
* 4 x M2 x 3mm screws
* 1 x 60% o-ring 
* 4 x Oval feets 20х3х1.5
